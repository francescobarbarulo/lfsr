\section{Introduction}
A Linear-Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state.

The most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.

The LFSR can be initialized with an initial value called seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. Likewise, because the register has a finite number of possible states, it must eventually enter a repeating cycle. However, an LFSR with a well-chosen feedback function can produce a sequence of bits that appears random and has a very long cycle.

It is necessary to ensure that the LFSR never enters an all-zeros state which is illegal because the register would remain locked-up in this state.

An LFSR is described by its feedback polynomial. The polynomial needs a number of bits according to its degree. Furthermore it has different periods of the repeating cycle: higher the degree is, longer the period is.

There are two architecture configurations through which an LFSR can be implemented, one called Fibonacci LFSR and the other called Galois LFSR.

    \label{fig:lfsr-f16}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fibonacci LFSR}
The bit positions that affect the next state are called taps. The rightmost bit of the LFSR is called the output bit. The taps are XORed sequentially with the output bit and then fed back into the leftmost bit. The sequence of bits in the rightmost position is called the output stream.

The arrangement of taps for feedback in an LFSR can be expressed in finite field arithmetic as a polynomial mod 2. This means that the coefficients of the polynomial must be 1s or 0s. The powers of the terms of the feedback polynomial represent the tapped bits, counting from the left.

In certain conditions the LFSR can cycles through all possible states; in this case the LFSR is maximal-length. This happens if and only if the corresponding feedback polynomial is primitive. Thus, the necessary conditions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the number of tap is even;
    \item the set of taps is setwise co-prime (there must be no divisor other than 1 common to all taps).
\end{itemize}

Below there is a C code example for the 16-bit maximal-period Fibonacci LFSR represented in Figure~\ref{fig:lfsr-f16}:

\subsection{Galois LFSR}
Named after the French mathematician Ã‰variste Galois, an LFSR in Galois configuration, which is also known as modular, internal XORs, or one-to-many LFSR, is an alternate structure that can generate the same output stream as a conventional LFSR (but offset in time). In the Galois configuration, when the system is clocked, bits that are not taps are shifted one position to the right unchanged. The taps, on the other hand, are XOR'd with the output bit before they are stored in the next position. The new output bit is the next input bit. The effect of this is that when the output bit is zero, all the bits in the register shift to the right unchanged, and the input bit becomes zero. When the output bit is one, the bits in the tap positions all flip (if they are 0, they become 1, and if they are 1, they become 0), and then the entire register is shifted to the right and the input bit becomes 1.

To generate the same output stream, the order of the taps is the counterpart of the order for the conventional LFSR, otherwise the stream will be in reverse. The internal state of the LFSR is not necessarily the same. A time offset exists between the streams, so a different startpoint will be needed to get the same output each cycle.

Galois LFSRs do not concatenate every tap to produce the new input (the XORing is done within the LFSR, and no XOR gates are run in serial, therefore the propagation times are reduced to that of one XOR rather than a whole chain), thus it is possible for each tap to be computed in parallel, increasing the speed of execution.

Below there is a C code example for the 16-bit maximal-period Galois LFSR represented in Figure~\ref{fig:lfsr-g16}:

\section{Applications}
LFSRs can be implemented in hardware, and this makes them useful in applications that require very fast generation of a pseudo-random sequence.

\subsection{Uses as counters}
The repeating sequence of states of an LFSR allows it to be used as a clock divider or as a counter when a non-binary sequence is acceptable, as is often the case where computer index or framing locations need to be machine-readable. LFSR counters have simpler feedback logic than natural binary counters or Gray-code counters, and therefore can operate at higher clock rates. One can obtain any other period by adding to an LFSR that has a longer period some logic that shortens the sequence by skipping some states.

\subsection{Uses in cryptography}
LFSRs have long been used as pseudo-random number generators for use in stream ciphers (especially in military cryptography), due to the ease of construction from simple electromechanical or electronic circuits, long periods, and very uniformly distributed output streams. However, an LFSR is a linear system, leading to fairly easy cryptanalysis. For example, given a stretch of known plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, an attacker can intercept and recover a stretch of LFSR output stream used in the system described, and from that stretch of the output stream can construct an LFSR of minimal size that simulates the intended receiver by using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. This LFSR can then be fed the intercepted stretch of output stream to recover the remaining plaintext.

Three general methods are employed to reduce this problem in LFSR-based stream ciphers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-linear combination of several bits from the LFSR state;
    \item Non-linear combination of the output bits of two or more LFSRs;
    \item Irregular clocking of the LFSR, as in the alternating step generator.
\end{itemize}

Important LFSR-based stream ciphers include A5/1 and A5/2, used in GSM cell phones, E0, used in Bluetooth, and the shrinking generator. The A5/2 cipher has been broken and both A5/1 and E0 have serious weaknesses.

\subsection{Uses in circuit testing}
LFSRs are used in circuit testing for test-pattern generation and for signature analysis.

\paragraph{Test-pattern generation}
Complete LFSR are commonly used as pattern generators for exhaustive testing, since they cover all possible inputs for an n-input circuit. Maximal-length LFSRs and weighted LFSRs are widely used as pseudo-random test-pattern generators for pseudo-random test applications.

\paragraph{Signature analysis}
In built-in self-test (BIST) techniques, storing all the circuit outputs on chip is not possible, but the circuit output can be compressed to form a signature that will later be compared to the golden signature (of the good circuit) to detect faults. Since this compression is lossy, there is always a possibility that a faulty output also generates the same signature as the golden signature and the faults cannot be detected. This condition is called error masking or aliasing. BIST is accomplished with a multiple-input signature register (MISR or MSR), which is a type of LFSR. A standard LFSR has a single XOR or XNOR gate, where the input of the gate is connected to several "taps" and the output is connected to the input of the first flip-flop. A MISR has the same structure, but the input to every flip-flop is fed through an XOR/XNOR gate. For example, a 4-bit MISR has a 4-bit parallel output and a 4-bit parallel input. The input of the first flip-flop is XOR/XNORd with parallel input bit zero and the "taps". Every other flip-flop input is XOR/XNORd with the preceding flip-flop output and the corresponding parallel input bit. Consequently, the next state of the MISR depends on the last several states opposed to just the current state. Therefore, a MISR will always generate the same golden signature given that the input sequence is the same every time.

\subsection{Uses in digital broadcasting and communications}
To prevent short repeating sequences (e.g., runs of 0s or 1s) from forming spectral lines that may complicate symbol tracking at the receiver or interfere with other transmissions, the data bit sequence is combined with the output of a linear-feedback register before modulation and transmission. This scrambling is removed at the receiver after demodulation. When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique is referred to as scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called chipping code. The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication. When used only for the spread-spectrum property, this technique is called direct-sequence spread spectrum; when used to distinguish several signals transmitted in the same channel at the same time and frequency, it is called code division multiple access.

\section{Architecture}

The assignment of this project is the realization of an LFSR with the following feedback polynomial:
$$ 1 + x^{11} + x^{13} + x^{14} + x^{16} $$

According to the degree of feedback polynomial, the register needs to store 16 bits where the taps are at the 16th, 14th, 13th and 11th bits.

The LFSR has to be able to be initilized, hence the INIT\_VALUE must be on 16 bits. Also the OUTPUT, which represents the current state of the register, must be on 16 bits. Furthermore there are one pin for the active low reset for the registers and one pin for the clock. In order to feed the register with the intial state there is one more pin EN, which acts as enable to determine whether the input of the i-th register has to get the value of the i-th bit of the seed or the output of the previous register.

The entity of the register is represented in Figure~\ref{fig:register}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/register}
    \caption{LFSR entity}
    \label{fig:register}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Use of D-flip-flop with enable}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/dff-en}
    \caption{D-flip-flop with enable}
    \label{fig:dff-en}
\end{figure}

Internally, the LFSR is composed by 16 D-flip-flop with enable. Each of them is composed by 5 inputs and 1 output:
\begin{itemize}
    \item input \texttt{a}, which takes the i-th bit of the seed;
    \item input \texttt{d}, which takes, at the first register that stores the most significant bit, the XORed value of the taps, while, at all the other registers, the output of the previous register;
    \item input \texttt{en}, on which depends the current value of \texttt{d\_s}: if \texttt{en} is equal to '0', \texttt{d\_s} takes the value of \texttt{a}, else it takes the value of \texttt{d};
    \item input \texttt{clk}, which is the clock of the D-flip-flop;
    \item input \texttt{rst\_n}, which is the active low reset for the D-flip-flop;
    \item output \texttt{q}, which is the output of the register.
    \end{itemize}
  
Below is the VHDL of the \texttt{dff\_en} entity according to Figure~\ref{fig:dff-en}:

\subsection{Implementation}
For the overall implementation of the LFSR has been chosen the Fibonacci one, which is explained in Figure~\ref{fig:lfsr}. The \texttt{dff\_en} are in series, however they can be loaded in parallel assigning \texttt{lfsr\_i(i)} to \texttt{a} input of the i-th \texttt{dff\_en}.

\section{Test plan}
The test plan is made using a bottom-up approach which foresees to test less complex components up to more complex architecture. For the LFSR, the objectives of tests are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item test the correctness of the \texttt{dff\_en} on which the LFSR is based;
    \item test the correctness of the LFSR.
\end{itemize}

The correctness is verified using known inputs and comparing the outputs with the expected ones. In this case, since the LFSR outputs are deterministic, it is easy enough.
 
Tests are done through testbenches that allow to simulate the behaviour of the components specifying the clock and the input values.

Simulations are made with Modelsim software.

\subsection{Dff\_en test}
The \texttt{dff\_en} is tested in the following way: first \texttt{en} is setted to '0' in order to see whether \texttt{q} is getting the value of \texttt{a}; then \texttt{en} is setted to '1' and \texttt{q} should get the values of \texttt{d}.

Below is the testbench for the \texttt{dff\_en}:

\lstinputlisting[language=VHDL, caption={Dff\_en testbench}, label={lst:dff-en-tb}, captionpos=b]{../dff_en_tb.vhd}

The simulation output is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dff-en-sim}.

    \caption{Dff\_en simulation}
    \label{fig:dff-en-sim}
\end{figure}

\subsection{LFSR test}
The LFSR is tested feeding the input with \texttt{0xACE1} value and comparing the output with the one got from the run of the code in Listing~\ref{lst:fibonacci-c}.

Below is the testbench for the LFSR:

\section{Logic Synthesis and implementation}
The logic synthesis is done on Xilinx Vivado Design Suite in an automatic way. All the VHDL code sources have been added to the project, the xc7z010clg400-1 device has been selected and the RTL analysis has been launched. The output of the elaborated design is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:elaborated-design}.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/elaborated-design}
    \caption{Elaborated design}
    \label{fig:elaborated-design}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Critical path and maximum frequency}
At first step, the synthesis has been launched with clock constraints equal to 8ns (125MHz) that is the frequency at which Zybo works.

The Worst Negative Slack (WNS) was around 5ns, hence it has been decremented untill one of the two design rules was not respected. At the end, the resulted maximum frequency is equal to 2.155ns with a slack of 0.280ns and the critical path is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:critical-path}.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/critical-path}

    \label{fig:critical-path}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Resources}
After the synthesis, the implementation run has been launched and the resulting utilized resources are those shown in Figure~\ref{fig:resources}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 9 x slice;
    \item 17 x LUT;
    \item 32 x FDCE.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This project has regarded the realization of the Linear Feedback Shift Register with the feedback polynomial $ 1 + x^{11} + x^{13} + x^{14} + x^{16} $. For the architecture description it has been used the VHDL language. The correctness of the circuit has been tested through simulations using testbenches. It has been done the logic synthesis in order to find the maximum frequency and the critical path. Finally, through the implementation run, it has been possible to know which Zybo resources have been used to implement the lfsr.
